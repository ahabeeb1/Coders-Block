Backend Development (Spring Boot & Java)
Project Setup & Architecture

Initialize a Spring Boot project with proper configuration (profiles, environment settings).
Establish a layered architecture (controllers, services, repositories) with DTOs for clean data transfer.
User Authentication & Authorization

Endpoints:
POST /auth/signup: User registration.
POST /auth/login: User authentication that issues JWTs.
Implement JWT-based authentication/authorization.
Use BCrypt for secure password hashing.
Develop a refresh token strategy for handling token expiration.
Challenge & Submission Management

Endpoints:
GET /api/challenges: Retrieve a list of challenges (with filtering by language/difficulty and pagination).
GET /api/challenges/{id}: (Optional) Fetch detailed challenge information.
POST /api/challenges/{id}/submit: Validate and store user submissions.
Ensure proper exception handling (e.g., via @ControllerAdvice).
User Dashboard & Progress Tracking

Endpoint:
GET /api/user/dashboard: Provide user progress, statistics, and tailored recommendations.
Develop additional endpoints (e.g., GET /api/user/progress) for detailed analytics.
AI Assistance Integration

Endpoint:
POST /api/ai/assist: Interface for AI-driven programming help, code explanation, and live debugging.
Optimize backend logic for handling RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) requests.
Optimization & Debugging

Optimize database queries using Spring Data JPA & Hibernate.
Debug common issues such as circular dependencies and connection errors. 2. Frontend Development (React.js / Next.js)
Project Initialization & Routing

Set up a React.js or Next.js project.
Configure React Router (or Next.js routing) for seamless page navigation.
Component & Page Structure

Components:
Header, Footer, and reusable UI elements (e.g., ChallengeCard).
Code editor integration (Monaco Editor) for interactive coding.
Pages:
Home, Login, Signup, Dashboard, and Challenges.
Organize utilities (e.g., api.js) for API calls.
UI/UX & State Management

Integrate a styling framework such as Material-UI or TailwindCSS.
Implement state management using React Context API or Redux.
Ensure responsive design and accessibility across devices.
Real-Time Features

Implement a real-time feedback system for user code submissions.
Handle asynchronous API calls gracefully, managing loading states and errors (e.g., addressing CORS issues). 3. Database Management (PostgreSQL & Vector Database)
Schema Design & Optimization

Users Table: id, username, email, password_hash, level.
Challenges Table: id, title, description, difficulty, language.
Submissions Table: id, user_id, challenge_id, code, status, timestamp.
Optimize query performance with proper indexing and pagination.
CRUD Operations & API Integration

Develop API calls for user progress (GET /api/user/progress), fetching challenges (GET /api/challenges?language=Java), and storing submissions.
Vector Database Setup for AI-Powered Retrieval

Integrate a vector database (e.g., Pinecone or Weaviate) to store embeddings of past solutions.
Implement vector search to retrieve similar challenges or code snippets for enhanced AI recommendations. 4. AI & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Integration
AI-Powered Features

Code Explanation: Provide detailed breakdowns of submitted challenge solutions.
Live Debugging: Assist users in detecting and fixing code errors in real time.
Challenge Recommendation: Tailor suggestions based on user skill level and previous performance.
RAG Implementation

Connect the AI agent with your vector database to fetch relevant past solutions or hints.
Develop logic to generate context-aware responses based on challenge details.
Continuously improve retrieval logic through feedback loops and usage analytics. 5. Authentication & Security
User Security

Implement JWT for secure API access.
Hash user passwords using BCrypt.
Develop strategies to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
Securely manage sensitive data using environment variables (.env files).
Session & Token Management

Ensure tokens have an expiration and implement refresh token functionality.
Validate tokens on every secure API call via Spring Security. 6. Infrastructure & Deployment (AWS & CI/CD)
Deployment Architecture

Frontend: Deploy on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
Backend: Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, or similar services.
Database: Utilize AWS RDS for PostgreSQL.
Containerization & CI/CD Pipeline

Containerize the application using Docker.
Set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins (or alternatives like GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
AWS Services & Monitoring

Integrate AWS services (e.g., S3 for static assets, CloudWatch for monitoring).
Set up logging and monitoring to track performance and debug issues quickly. 7. Development Workflow & Common Issue Resolution
Development Workflow

Step 1: Develop and test backend APIs (Spring Boot, PostgreSQL).
Step 2: Build frontend components and integrate the code editor.
Step 3: Connect frontend with backend APIs (Axios, React Query).
Step 4: Integrate AI-powered assistance and RAG features.
Step 5: Deploy and continuously monitor performance.
Common Issues & Fixes

API Not Responding: Verify Spring Boot service is running (e.g., via mvn spring-boot:run).
CORS Issues: Configure Spring Boot controllers with @CrossOrigin.
Database Connection Failures: Check AWS RDS security groups and connection settings.
React State Not Updating: Utilize useEffect() and ensure proper state management.
Incorrect AI Responses: Refine retrieval-augmented generation logic and adjust vector database settings.
